Professor Pearson,

I had issues sourcing the textbook this week and it should be delivered Monday or Tuesday. 
I have prior experience with HTML and CSS and attempted to meet the proficiencies required by this case study.
I also have the site live, and I tried to make it as pretty as possible without going overboard.
It can be found at https://ch-2-yoga-jordan.netlify.com and I have the rest of the files located on my github 
if you'd like to see the full project https://github.com/jbryan382/ch-2-yoga.

Respectfully,
Jordan Bryan
